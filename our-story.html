            <h2>Our Story</h2>

We aren't just another software company, we are a unique company offering services to clients who want to be able to take control of their business, manage their website, staff, products, and anything you could ever need.

                    <!-- <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Pier Solutions was founded to bring unique websites and software to clients around the globe. A lot of big website builders and software companies oversimplify the simplicity of building software, and what actually goes in to getting the website / software applications exactly how you want it. The name 'Pier Solutions', comes from how a pier stares out onto the open water, and when standing on the pier, you take in your surroundings, allowing you to feel that the world is yours, all at the tip of your fingers, able to achieve anything. And that is the story of Pier Solutions!</p> -->

            <p class="separator">Hi! My name is Gianluca Astorino, I am the Founder here at Indera Technologies. 
                You've probably already read it on our home page, but we at Indera Tech take pride in the fact that we offer unique tech services 
                to clients globally. <br><br>So now the big question remains, why did I start this company. Well, I always had a passion for tech, and
                my love of computers strands from when I was a kid. As I started coding, I gave web development a shot, and well, it was love at first site. I realized how much I love being able to 
                design, and develop something from scratch for others, and have my work be seen and used by thousands of people, and how people trust me to create something that
                represents their business and their passion. It's truly rewarding for me.<br><br>Since I founded Indera Technologies back in early 2020, we have developed an almost uncountable number of websites,
                web apps, and other software solutions for businesses around the globe. We have had the honor of working with Enterprise sized clients, Social Media Giants, some awesome athletes and entrepreneurs, small and medium sized businesses, and startups. All of our developers have dozens of years of experience, and have created hundreds of sites on their own, which they use their skills and expertise to design, and develop your sites! We now have a fantastic team of Sales Associates, Developers,
                and Partner Organizations around the globe. <br><br>
                <h2>Indera Foundation</h2>
                <br>
                It is also my mission, and my company's mission to help people around the world, and give back to the community. That is why we pledge 1% of our revenue to go towards helping the homeless in our home city, Toronto, and children in Africa.
